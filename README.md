# efficient-ddl-usage
used obsidian, open source cs customskin, lol2gltf, etc for this project
The idea is to create the most efficient, clear cut, and concise reskin mod which will allow for optimal understanding of hitboxes etc. 
riot seems to have optimized entertainment value when creating the original Zac skin, but I hope to create another valid option for tryhards
