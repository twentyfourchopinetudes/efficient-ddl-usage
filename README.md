# efficient-ddl-usage
used obsidian, open source cs customskin, lol2gltf, etc for this project
The idea is to create the most efficient, clear cut, and concise reskin mod which will allow for optimized usage which simply isn't possible with the original project
riot optimized entertainment value when creating the original Zac skin, but I hope to create another valid option for tryhards like me
